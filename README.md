This api allows users to enter the name of a Premier league team and find their odds of winning. In order to acheive this it uses a data base of Premier league statistics. We took data from the csv files and placed them into lists. We  then used this data to calculate win probabilities.  We thought it was interesting as we are fans of soccer and often clash on what teams are better.
